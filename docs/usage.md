## CRISPR Screens

OUTERSPACE (Optimized Utilities for Tracking Enrichment in Screens through Precise Analysis of CRISPR Experiments) is designed to analyze data from CRISPR screens. These screens typically involve:

1. Creating a library of guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting genes of interest
2. Delivery of the gRNA library into cells by lentiviral infection
3. Selection or screening process
4. Sequencing of the gRNA sequences before and after selection
5. Analysis of gRNA abundance changes

Check out this [AddGene writeup](https://www.addgene.org/guides/pooled-libraries/) for more details.

The proposed OUTERSPACE workflow helps process and analyze this data through several steps:

1. **Sequence Extraction** (`findseq`): Extracts gRNA sequences and associated barcodes from FASTQ files using configurable search patterns.

2. **Barcode Correction** (`collapse`): Corrects sequencing errors in barcodes using UMI-tools algorithms to improve accuracy.

3. **Counting** (`count`): Quantifies the frequency of each gRNA-barcode combination.

4. **Statistical Analysis** (`stats`): Calculates comprehensive statistics including Gini coefficients, Shannon diversity, and other metrics to analyze barcode distributions. This is useful for diagnostic purposes and diversity assessment.

5. **Visualization** (`visualize`): Creates plots to help interpret the results.

This integrated toolset helps researchers accurately measure changes in gRNA abundance between conditions, identify hits from their screens, and ensure data quality through multiple analysis steps.

### Usage Story

```bash
# Extract sequences
outerspace findseq -c config.toml -1 ctrl_r1.fastq.gz -2 ctrl_r2.fastq.gz -o ctrl_output.csv
outerspace findseq -c config.toml -1 exp_r1.fastq.gz -2 exp_r2.fastq.gz -o exp_output.csv

# Correct barcodes (uses config settings)
outerspace collapse -c config.toml --input-file ctrl_output.csv --output-file ctrl_output_collapsed.csv
outerspace collapse -c config.toml --input-file exp_output.csv --output-file exp_output_collapsed.csv

# Count barcodes (uses config settings)
outerspace count -c config.toml --input-file ctrl_output_collapsed.csv --output-file ctrl_counts.csv
outerspace count -c config.toml --input-file exp_output_collapsed.csv --output-file exp_counts.csv

# Calculate statistics (uses config settings)
outerspace stats -c config.toml ctrl_counts.csv exp_counts.csv

# Visualize results
outerspace visualize -c config.toml output_plots ctrl_counts exp_counts
```

## Barcoded Viruses for Latency Studies

Barcoded viruses, such as SIVmac293m2, are powerful tools for studying viral latency and reservoir dynamics in animal models.
These viruses contain unique molecular barcodes integrated into their genome, allowing researchers to track individual viral lineages.

Here's how they work:

1. A pool of viruses, each containing a unique barcode sequence, is used to infect the animal model
2. During infection, each virus integrates its genome (including the barcode) into host cells
3. Some infected cells become latently infected, harboring dormant virus
4. When sampling tissues, the barcodes can be sequenced to:
   - Identify which viral variants established latent infection
   - Track the clonal expansion of infected cells
   - Map the anatomical distribution of viral reservoirs
   - Monitor changes in the reservoir composition over time

### Using OUTERSPACE for Barcode Analysis

OUTERSPACE is well-suited for analyzing barcode sequencing data from these experiments:

1. **Sequence Extraction**: The `findseq` command can extract viral barcodes from sequencing reads using configurable patterns that match the barcode context.

2. **Error Correction**: The `collapse` command corrects sequencing errors in barcodes, ensuring accurate lineage tracking. This is crucial because even single nucleotide errors could artificially inflate diversity estimates.

3. **Quantification**: The `count` command determines the frequency of each viral barcode in different samples, revealing the relative abundance of viral variants.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: The `stats` command calculates comprehensive statistics including Gini coefficients, Shannon diversity, and other metrics to analyze barcode distributions, helping identify:
   - Bottleneck effects during transmission
   - Clonal expansion of infected cells
   - Changes in reservoir diversity over time

5. **Visualization**: The `visualize` command creates plots to help interpret the distribution of viral barcodes across different samples.

For a detailed tutorial using real SIV barcoding data, see the [SIV Barcoding Tutorial](tutorials/siv-barcoding/README.md).

### Example Pipeline

For analyzing viral barcode data, you can use the `pipeline` command to run all steps automatically:

```bash
outerspace pipeline config.toml snakemake_config.yaml \
    --snakemake-args="--cores 4"
```

This will:
1. Process all FASTQ files specified in the Snakemake configuration
2. Extract and correct barcodes using patterns in `config.toml`
3. Count unique barcodes per sample
4. Generate metrics and visualizations
5. Save all results in the output directory

For comprehensive pipeline setup and advanced Snakemake options (including cluster execution), see the [Pipeline Tutorial](tutorials/pipeline/README.md).

Alternatively, you can run individual commands:

```bash
# Extract viral barcodes
outerspace findseq -c config.toml -1 viral_reads.fastq.gz -o viral_barcodes.csv

# Correct barcode errors (uses config settings)
outerspace collapse -c config.toml --input-file viral_barcodes.csv --output-file corrected_barcodes.csv

# Count barcodes per sample (uses config settings)
outerspace count -c config.toml --input-file corrected_barcodes.csv --output-file barcode_counts.csv

# Analyze distribution (uses config settings)
outerspace stats -c config.toml barcode_counts.csv
```
